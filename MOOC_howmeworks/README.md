## Homeworks from stepic.org MOOC "Basics of programming for Linux"

[This](https://stepik.org/course/%D0%9E%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-Linux-548) is one of my favourites MOOC ever.  
This course covers all basics things about programming for Linux: IPC, network stack, disk operations, etc.  
Kirill Krunkin is a fantastic lecturer and could explain any complicated details in a clear and straightforward way.  
But you should know the Russian language to be able to understand him ;)
