#### Hello <%username%>,

I finaly understand that every good programmer have to know how OS works in deep.

Recently I have started to study several MOOCs about Unix, Linux kernel programming and low-level stuffs.

In this repo I will publish my masterpieces libs, tiny programms and useful tools which I will create on my road to Mighty UNIX Kernel Programming Skills :muscle:


P.S. I would be appreciate for any help: :star:, advices or issues :wink:
